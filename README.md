# 🐾 Kindred Take-Home Project: Pet Swapping Mini-App

Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to complete our take-home challenge.
This is meant to simulate a real (but lighthearted) Kindred product experience, with a twist: instead of homes, you'll be helping people find pet-sitting buddies!

## ✨ Project Brief

You'll build a minimal cross-platform experience for browsing and "booking" pets available for swapping/sitting. The goal is to showcase your frontend skills in both React Native and Next.js, your technical and product thinking, and your ability to communicate clearly.

---

## 🕐 Time Expectations

- **This should take you no more than 4 hours.**
- Please don't over-engineer or polish beyond that.
- If you run over, just note what you'd do with more time in your submission.

---

## 🚩 Requirements

### **Functional**

1. **Pet List**

   - Fetch a list of pets from the mock API (`GET /api/pets`).
   - Display pet info: photo, name, species, city, and status.
   - Indicate if the pet is "booked" or "available."

2. **Booking Action**

   - Allow users to "Book" an available pet.
   - Simulate booking with `POST /api/book/:petId` (just fake the call and update UI).
   - Show a success message and prevent double-booking.

3. **Responsiveness & Usability**

   - The web view should be mobile responsive.
   - The mobile app should feel native.
   - Add **1 meaningful UX/UI enhancement** of your choice (eg. loading skeleton, nice transitions, etc.).

### **Technical**

- Use **TypeScript** throughout.
- Use a modern React stack: Expo for mobile, Next.js for web.
- Minimize boilerplate—focus on essentials.
- Include **unit tests for a core logic module** (your choice).
- Show how you'd organize code for scaling.
- Provide **clear run instructions** in this README.

## 🤖 About Using AI

- You **may use AI/code assistants** to help you, but _you_ should own and understand all code.
- Please note in your submission (in this README) if/where you used AI to assist.
- Do not copy-paste full, unedited AI-generated screens or logic.

---

## 📄 What to Submit

- Push your code to your assignment repo.
- **Update this README** with:

  - Your approach and any tradeoffs.
  - Time spent.
  - Where/if you used AI.
  - How to run both web and mobile apps.
  - (If needed) What you'd do with more time.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### **Install dependencies**

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### **Start the mock API**

```bash
cd mock-api
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

This starts the JSON server at `http://localhost:3001`.

### **Run the Web App**

```bash
cd web
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

### **Run the Mobile App**

```bash
cd mobile
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

This will start Expo—use your device or an emulator to test.

## 📝 Please Include

- **Time spent:**
- **Where/if you used AI/code assistants:**
- **If I had more time, I'd...**
- **Anything else you want us to know:**

**Thanks and have fun with it!**
